# ScammerBeGone

This program is more of a gimmick, its purpose is to use all available upload bandwidth to spam as many requests as your pc can handle.

## Usage
download the release or clone the repo and build the program, after that open a console in the working directory of the exe, then enter the name of the exe with the following parameters: \
*.exe [threadsize] [requestcount] [requestsize] [targeturl]* \
so for a context with 20 threads and 2 million requests that upload 8mb of data everytime to http://localhost/ (do not try this tbh). 

**.\ScammerBeGoneConsole.exe 20 2000000 8 http://localhost/**

## Furthermore

use at own risk, if ur pc dies because you are stupid, then you are stupid.

also feel free to contribute with stuff to make this program a little fancyier
